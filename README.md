Before completing the lab assignment you must:
1. configure Git and GitHub on your computer. See [worksheet1 (configure Git and GitHub)](https://github.com/gallettilance/CS506-Spring2026/blob/main/lecture_01/worksheet_01.ipynb)
2. review the slides (lab 1 - IntroGit) and/or watch the video - [CS 506 Sp'26 Lab 1 (Slide walkthrough)](https://youtu.be/5TzO1p77B1o)

For the lab assignment, [this video](https://youtu.be/7_sJVIr3MfI) walks you through the entire assignment, just on a different repo. If you are confident in your Git/GitHub skills, feel free to do it without the video!

Your assignment:
1. Fork this repository (original repository)
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote
4. Sync your local main branch with upstream/main (hint: use git pull on the upstream remote)
5. Create and switch to a new branch in your fork
6. Push the new branch to your fork on GitHub
7. Add your name to names.md on the new branch
8. Stage your changes and then push to your fork on GitHub while on the branch
9. Open a pull request to the original repository to merge your changes to names.md to the original repo (you will get credit for your name appearing in names.md after the PR is approved)
